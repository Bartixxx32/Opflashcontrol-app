# OnePlus Flash Control

OnePlus Flash Control is an Android application designed specifically for rooted OnePlus devices, providing users with precise control over the brightness of the dual-tone LED flashes. The app offers a user-friendly interface to easily adjust the master brightness and independently control the brightness of the white, yellow.

By leveraging root access, the app allows direct modification of system-level files to control the LED behavior, enabling a customized and enhanced flashlight experience on your OnePlus device.

## Features

- **Master Brightness Control:** Adjust overall LED brightness with a single slider.
- **Individual LED Control:** Independently control the brightness of white and yellow LEDs.
- **"Eye Destroyer" Mode:** A feature to momentarily turn on the LEDs at maximum brightness for both white and yellow LEDs.
- ⚠️ Use with caution as it emits very intense light and generates significant heat! ⚠️
- Safety features to prevent prolonged high brightness usage:
  - If brightness exceeds 120 (on a scale of 0-255) for more than 20 seconds, it automatically reduces back to the default Android brightness value to prevent overheating or damage.
  - "Eye Destroyer" Mode enforces a 5-second cooldown between uses to ensure safety and prevent excessive heat buildup.

- **Compatibility:** Designed for rooted OnePlus devices only.
- **Quick Settings Tile:** Conveniently control LED brightness and state using a Quick Settings tile:
  - Single tap cycles through brightness levels.
  - Double tap when LEDs are off to turn them on at 80% brightness.
  - Double tap when LEDs are on to turn them off.
- **Secret Action:** Unlock hidden features by tapping the app's title 5 times within 5 seconds, enabling a fun experimental mode.
