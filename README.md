# OnePlus Flash Control

OnePlus Flash Control is an Android application designed specifically for rooted OnePlus devices, providing users with precise control over the brightness of the dual-tone and quad-tone LED flashes. The app offers a user-friendly interface to easily adjust the master brightness and independently control the brightness of the white, yellow, and additional LEDs (for quad-tone setups).

By leveraging root access, the app allows direct modification of system-level files to control the LED behavior, enabling a customized and enhanced flashlight experience on your OnePlus device.

## Features

- **Master Brightness Control:** Adjust overall LED brightness with a single slider.
- **Individual LED Control:** Independently control the brightness of white and yellow LEDs.
- **"Eye Destroyer" Mode:** A feature to momentarily turn on the LEDs at maximum brightness for both white and yellow LEDs. Use with caution as it emits very intense light!
- **Compatibility:** Designed for rooted OnePlus devices only.
- **Quad LED Control:** Control up to four LEDs on supported OnePlus devices (OnePlus 9 series and newer). Currently in development:
  - Support for controlling additional LED modules (warm and cool tones)
  - Brightness synchronization across all LEDs


  Testing needed: If you have a OnePlus 9/10/11 series device, please help by:
  - Confirming the number and types of LED modules on your device
  - Testing brightness control functionality and reporting any issues
  - Sharing your device model and OxygenOS/Custom ROM version in GitHub Issues
