# OnePlus Flash Control

OnePlus Flash Control is an Android application designed specifically for rooted OnePlus devices, providing users with precise control over the brightness of the dual-tone and quad-tone LED flashes. The app offers a user-friendly interface to easily adjust the master brightness and independently control the brightness of the white, yellow, and additional LEDs (for quad-tone setups).

## Features

- **Master Brightness Control:** Adjust overall LED brightness with a single slider.
- **Individual LED Control:** Independently control the brightness of white and yellow LEDs.
- **"Eye Destroyer" Mode:** A feature to momentarily turn on the LEDs at maximum brightness for both white and yellow LEDs. Use with caution as it emits very intense light!
- **Compatibility:** Designed for rooted OnePlus devices with dual-tone LED flash.
- **Quad LED Control:** Control up to four LEDs, with support for dual-tone flash on OnePlus devices. (Work in progress, reports needed for testing.)
